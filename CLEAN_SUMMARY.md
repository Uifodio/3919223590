- **`launch_anora.py`** - Fixed launcher that works properly
- **`build_exe_alternative.py`** - The only build file that works (kept as requested)
- **`requirements.txt`** - Dependencies

### 🧪 **Test Files:**
- **`test_nova.py`** - Simple test to verify Nova Editor works
- **`test_editor.py`** - Comprehensive test suite
- **`test_syntax.py`** - Syntax highlighting test
- **`test_python.py`** - Sample Python file
- **`test_csharp.cs`** - Sample C# file
- **`test_javascript.js`** - Sample JavaScript file
- **`test_html.html`** - Sample HTML file

### 📖 **Documentation:**
- **`README.md`** - Main documentation
- **`NOVA_EDITOR_COMPLETE.md`** - Complete feature guide
- **`CLEAN_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **Quick Start:**
```bash

### **Build Executable (Windows):**
```bash

python3 build_exe_alternative.py
```
