# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## **Step 1: Run the Diagnostic**
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in this folder and run:
```bash
node diagnostic.js
```

This will check your system and tell you if everything is ready. Look for green ✅ checkmarks!

## **Step 2: Choose Your Build Method**

### **Option A: Automatic Build (Recommended)**
Double-click `build.bat` (or `build.ps1` for PowerShell)

This will:
- ✅ Check your system
- ✅ Install dependencies  
- ✅ Test the app
- ✅ Build the .exe file
- ✅ Tell you exactly where to find it

### **Option B: Manual Build**
If you prefer to do it step by step:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test the app
npm start

# Build the executable
npm run build-win
```

## **Step 3: Install and Use**

1. **Find your .exe file** in the `dist` folder
2. **Double-click** `Unity Code Editor Setup.exe`
3. **Follow the installer** - it's just like installing any Windows app
4. **Launch from Start Menu** or Desktop shortcut

## **What You'll Get**

🎯 **A professional code editor** that looks and feels like VS Code
📁 **File manager** that works exactly like Windows Explorer  
🎨 **Dark theme** with syntax highlighting for C#, JavaScript, Python, etc.
📝 **Multiple tabs** for editing many files at once
⚡ **Fast and lightweight** - no more Visual Studio bloat!

## **Perfect for Unity Development**

- ✅ C# syntax highlighting
- ✅ Unity script templates
- ✅ File explorer for your Unity projects
- ✅ Professional code editing experience
- ✅ Much faster than Visual Studio

## **If Something Goes Wrong**

1. **Check the diagnostic output** - it tells you exactly what's wrong
2. **Make sure Node.js is installed** - you said you have it
3. **Run as Administrator** if you get permission errors
4. **Check disk space** - you need at least 1GB free

## **Need Help?**

The diagnostic script will catch 99% of issues and tell you exactly how to fix them. If you still have problems, the error messages will be very specific about what's wrong.
