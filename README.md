# Nova Explorer

Nova Explorer is a Windows 11 native-style file manager + code editor built with Python and PySide6. It combines a fast Explorer with a built-in editor, ZIP browsing, drag-and-drop, backups, and multi-window project mode. Portable and MSI installer builds are supported.

## Features
- Explorer tree, tabbed views, dark theme
- Built-in editor with syntax highlighting, find/replace, autosave, undo/redo
- Image viewer and quick preview
- Fast search: names and in-file text
- Drag-and-drop between windows and to external apps (Unity, VS, browsers)
- File ops with progress: copy/move/rename/delete/duplicate; safe delete to Recycle Bin
- ZIP browsing/editing with .bak backups
- Recent locations, settings JSON, cross-window clipboard
- Multi-window project mode

## Quick Start (Windows)
1. Download the latest release from GitHub Releases.
2. Run `NovaExplorer.exe` (portable) or install with `NovaExplorer.msi`.

## Build From Source

1. Install Python 3.11+ and Git.
2. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/nova-explorer.git
   cd nova-explorer
   ```
3. Setup venv and dependencies:
   ```bash
   scripts\windows\setup_venv.bat
   ```
4. Run (portable dev):
   ```bash
   scripts\windows\run_dev.bat
   ```
5. Build EXE and MSI:
   ```bash
   scripts\windows\build_exe.bat
   scripts\windows\build_msi.bat
   ```

If Python is missing, the build script bootstraps a private embeddable Python automatically.

## Unity Integration
You can set Nova Explorer as the external code editor and double-click to open files. In Unity: Edit -> Preferences -> External Tools -> External Script Editor: browse to `NovaExplorer.exe`.
