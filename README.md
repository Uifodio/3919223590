Welcome to your workspace! This is a clean development environment ready for your next project.

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ src/               # Source code directory
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/              # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/             # Test files
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore         # Git ignore rules
```

## Getting Started

1. Create the basic directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src docs tests
   ```

2. Start developing in the `src/` directory
3. Add documentation in the `docs/` directory
4. Write tests in the `tests/` directory

## Development Guidelines

- Keep source code organized in the `src/` directory
- Maintain clear documentation
- Write tests for your code
- Use meaningful file and directory names

Happy Coding! ðŸŽ‰
