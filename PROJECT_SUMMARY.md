## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
1. **Run the launcher** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 launch_anora.py
   ```

2. **Or run directly**:
   ```bash
   python3 anora_editor.py
   ```

   ```bash
   python3 test_editor.py
   ```

### Unity Workflow
1. **Launch Anora Editor**
2. **Click "📌 Pin"** to keep it always on top
3. **Resize the window** to overlay Unity viewport
4. **Open your C# scripts** with `Ctrl+O` or drag them in
5. **Edit quickly** while keeping Unity visible
6. **Use "⛶ Full"** for distraction-free coding when needed

## 🎯 Perfect for Unity Development

### Why It's Better Than Visual Studio for Unity:
- **Lightning Fast** - Starts instantly, no heavy IDE overhead
- **Always Accessible** - Pin it on top, never lose it behind Unity
- **Compact** - Small footprint, doesn't take up screen space
- **Focused** - No unnecessary features, just what you need for coding
- **Professional** - Beautiful dark theme that matches modern development tools
- **Fast File Operations** - Quick save, open, and edit capabilities

### Unity-Specific Features:
- **C# Syntax Highlighting** - Perfect for Unity scripts
- **Quick Tab Switching** - Switch between multiple scripts instantly
- **Search & Replace** - Find and replace across your codebase
- **Line Numbers** - Easy debugging and navigation
- **Modified Indicators** - See which files have unsaved changes

## 🔧 Building the Executable

To create a standalone executable:

```bash
python3 build_exe.py
```

This will create:
- `dist/AnoraEditor.exe` - Standalone executable
- `install_anora.bat` - Windows installer script

## 🎨 Professional Design

### Dark Theme Colors:
- Background: `#1e1e1e` (VS Code-style dark)
- Text: `#d4d4d4` (high contrast)
- Selection: `#264f78` (blue selection)
- Tabs: `#2d2d30` (subtle tab background)
- Buttons: `#3e3e42` (modern button style)

### Syntax Highlighting:
- Keywords: Blue (`#569cd6`)
- Strings: Orange (`#ce9178`)
- Comments: Green (`#6a9955`)
- Numbers: Light green (`#b5cea8`)
- Functions: Yellow (`#dcdcaa`)

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python3 test_editor.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Test all imports
- ✅ Verify editor creation
- ✅ Check syntax highlighting
- ✅ Create sample files for testing
